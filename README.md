App Evaluation

Category: Health & Fitness
Mobile: The idea for the app is very simple, but rather unique. The only other option is to use 2 different apps such as FitnessPal and some Gym tracker app. FitLife does both as well as touches on your mood.

Story: It is very clear as the app strives to create a habit of going to the Gym, track what you eat and provide feedback on your workouts.

Market: Market is huge as it is very popular to maintain healthy lifestyle. It is projected to reach $16 billion by 2026. My friends would definitely agree to use something like this. The audience group is mostly young to middle age people that are interested in a healthy lifestyle. As well as smaller groups such as people who are on the mission to lose weight.

Habit:An average user would open this app most likely 2-3 times a week to enter their data or to monitor it. Which may vary. The average user is creating while using it for the most part as the app is designed to help you and show how you progess.

Scope: It is fairly challenging to create this app. Most of the implementation has been covered in our labs and projects. A stripped down version would still be interesting as it requires to work with API's and visually appealing design.
